    - Fix for pp_match in Perl 5.22+ (#23)

    - On recent Perls (5.22 and 5.24, maybe more) this module could detect an
      unused variable named "$". This was a bogus false positive, as opposed
      to just a missing variable name in the output. Reported by Alexander
      Hartmaier. GitHub #22.
    - Fixed tests to use File::Spec->catfile to generate paths so that tests
      pass on Windows. Reported by Paul Durden. Based on GitHub PR #20.

    - In some corner cases, Test::Vars would try to look inside the body of a
      stub sub ("sub foo;") and then blow up. This could be triggered by
      declaring a stub sub and then an attribute with a reader of the same
      name in a Moose::Role, for example. Reported by Andy Jack.

    - Fix tests with threaded Perl 5.22+. Reported by Paul Howarth.

    - This module now calls Test::Builder->diag and ->note _after_ calling
      ->ok. This is more in line with how most test modules work. Patch by Ran
      Eilam.
    - Added a new exported sub, test_vars(), which does not output TAP. This
      is useful for integrating this module with things like
      Code::TidyAll. Patch by Dave Rolsky.
